# Demand Forecasting and Inventory Optimisation

Accurate Demand Forecasting and Inventory Optimization are crucial for businesses in retail, manufacturing, and distribution industries. They help allocate resources, manage inventory, and plan production while meeting customer needs, avoiding overstocking or understocking, and optimizing supply chain operations.

To start, we gather historical data and external factors like seasonality, promotions, and economic trends. We use forecasting models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, or exponential smoothing for demand forecasting. Then, we optimize inventory levels using strategies like reordering points, safety stock, and calculating the economic order quantity (EOQ).
